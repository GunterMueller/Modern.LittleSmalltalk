This is Little Smalltalk version 3.10, originally written by Tim Budd
and then extensively hacked by Hellwig Geisse.

Please read the document install.ms (to typeset use troff -ms) for
installation instructions.

The document manual.ms provides the start of a manual; it needs to
be rewritten.

Please report bugs, and one of these days I (Tim Budd) may even find
time to fix them! You can also report bugs to me (Hellwig Geisse) and
I will try my best to fix them.
