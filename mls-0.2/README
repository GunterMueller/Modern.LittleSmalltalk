Welcome to Modern Little Smalltalk!

This is a re-implementation of Little Smalltalk,
an object-oriented language and corresponding class
library written many years ago by Tim Budd of Oregon
State University. It is similar to Smalltalk-80, but
approximately an order of magnitude less complex.

Please report bugs to Hellwig.Geisse@mni.fh-giessen.de;
he did not necessarily make them all by himself, but he
feels responsible for fixing them ;-)

Have fun!
