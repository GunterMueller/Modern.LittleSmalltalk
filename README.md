THis is a fork of Hellwig Geisse's Modern LittleSmalltalk

 Welcome to Modern Little Smalltalk!

This is a re-implementation of Little Smalltalk, an object-oriented language and corresponding
class library written many years ago by Tim Budd of Oregon State University. It is similar to
Smalltalk-80, but approximately an order of magnitude less complex.

Here is the old software:

Tim Budd's Little Smalltalk version 3: small.v3.tar
A cleaned-up version of the above: small-3.10.tar.gz
Guido van Rossum's windowing package: stdwin-0.9.7.tar.gz

There has not been any code released yet from the Modern Little Smalltalk project - we only
have some code fragments. Nevertheless here they are:

mls-0.0.tar.gz [old]
mls-0.1.tar.gz [old]
mls-0.2.tar.gz [stable]

Good luck & have fun!
